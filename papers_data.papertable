Operating in a cold-start setting, our approach creates designs without iterative feedback from wet laboratory experiments or computational simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by designing antibody libraries for Trastuzumab in complex with the HER2 receptor, showing that it outperforms existing techniques in overall quality and diversity of the generated libraries.

                "abstract": "Evolution has optimized proteins over time by the incorporation of precise and context-specific amino acid substitutions adapted to structural and functional demands. We have reconceptualized this principle using deep learning to engineer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting immune checkpoints PD-1 and LAG-3. These two checkpoints are targeted synergistically in combination immunotherapy to minimize cancer cell evasion. From the established antibodies, the best set was selected based on their clinical validation. These served as templates to improve binding affinity and therapeutic potential in the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. To guide antibody design, we formulated inverse modeling pipeline using message passing graph neural network for protein sequence design given a fixed backbone structure. This led to the prediction of functionally viable substitutions at the receptor-antibody interface. Resulting variant models were filtered based on physicochemical accuracy, evolutionary feasibility, empirical validation, geometric complementarity and machine learning guided mutation prediction, ensuring structural integrity and enhanced performance. In addition, thermostability and immunogenicity analyses of the filtered ones were carried out. Ultimately, the top candidates were subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations leading to post simulation trajectory analysis including stability, interaction and energy decomposition analysis. After a robust computational evaluation, seven variants exhibited improved network stability and superior binding as compared to their respective references. Moreover, we have also added negative control to reinforce the novelty and importance of our framework. Our results establish a robust and scalable framework to design ICIs and underscores potential leads having improved binding, concertedly targeting PD-1 and LAG-3, paving the path for next-generation immunotherapy.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Evolution has optimized proteins over time by the incorporation of precise and context-specific amino acid substitutions adapted to structural and functional demands. We have reconceptualized this principle using deep learning to engineer monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting immune checkpoints PD-1 and LAG-3. These two checkpoints are targeted synergistically in combination immunotherapy to minimize cancer cell evasion. From the established antibodies, the best set was selected based on their clinical validation. These served as templates to improve binding affinity and therapeutic potential in the heterogeneous tumor microenvironment. To guide antibody design, we formulated inverse modeling pipeline using message passing graph neural network for protein sequence design given a fixed backbone structure. This led to the prediction of functionally viable substitutions at the receptor-antibody interface. Resulting variant models were filtered based on physicochemical accuracy, evolutionary feasibility, empirical validation, geometric complementarity and machine learning guided mutation prediction, ensuring structural integrity and enhanced performance. In addition, thermostability and immunogenicity analyses of the filtered ones were carried out. Ultimately, the top candidates were subjected to molecular dynamic (MD) simulations leading to post simulation trajectory analysis including stability, interaction and energy decomposition analysis. After a robust computational evaluation, seven variants exhibited improved network stability and superior binding as compared to their respective references. Moreover, we have also added negative control to reinforce the novelty and importance of our framework. Our results establish a robust and scalable framework to design ICIs and underscores potential leads having improved binding, concertedly targeting PD-1 and LAG-3, paving the path for next-generation immunotherapy."

However, unlike conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), sdAbs lack an Fc domain, limiting their functional versatility and manufacturability. To address this challenge, we developed TFDesign-sdAb, a deep learning-based generative-ranking framework that enables rational engineering of sdAbs with tailored functionalities. Our framework integrates a structure-aware diffusion model (IgGM) for large-scale candidate generation and a fine-tuned sorter (A2binder) that evaluates and prioritizes them based on predicted functionality. Unlike traditional CDR-focused approaches, TFDesign-sdAb optimizes both complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FRs), allowing sdAbs to acquire new functional properties while maintaining antigen specificity. We validated our approach by conferring Protein A binding to human VHs and nanobodies that originally lacked this feature, achieving high expression rates, strong binding affinities, and successful purification via industry-standard Protein A affinity chromatography. High-resolution structural characterization (1.49\u2009\u00c5 and 2.0\u2009\u00c5) of the redesigned sdAb-Protein A complexes revealed conserved FR-mediated binding motifs that recapitulate natural Fc-Protein A interactions, validating the accuracy of our model. Furthermore, our pipeline streamlined the antibody engineering process, achieving a 100% success rate in generating Protein A-binding sdAbs while maintaining their original antigen-binding affinity. This work demonstrates the power of AI-driven design in overcoming long-standing limitations in antibody engineering and presents a scalable, generalizable solution for enhancing sdAb functionality.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) have emerged as powerful therapeutic agents due to their small size, high stability, and superior tissue penetration. However, unlike conventional monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), sdAbs lack an Fc domain, limiting their functional versatility and manufacturability. To address this challenge, we developed TFDesign-sdAb, a deep learning-based generative-ranking framework that enables rational engineering of sdAbs with tailored functionalities. Our framework integrates a structure-aware diffusion model (IgGM) for large-scale candidate generation and a fine-tuned sorter (A2binder) that evaluates and prioritizes them based on predicted functionality. Unlike traditional CDR-focused approaches, TFDesign-sdAb optimizes both complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) and framework regions (FRs), allowing sdAbs to acquire new functional properties while maintaining antigen specificity. We validated our approach by conferring Protein A binding to human VHs and nanobodies that originally lacked this feature, achieving high expression rates, strong binding affinities, and successful purification via industry-standard Protein A affinity chromatography. High-resolution structural characterization (1.49\u2009\u00c5 and 2.0\u2009\u00c5) of the redesigned sdAb-Protein A complexes revealed conserved FR-mediated binding motifs that recapitulate natural Fc-Protein A interactions, validating the accuracy of our model. Furthermore, our pipeline streamlined the antibody engineering process, achieving a 100% success rate in generating Protein A-binding sdAbs while maintaining their original antigen-binding affinity. This work demonstrates the power of AI-driven design in overcoming long-standing limitations in antibody engineering and presents a scalable, generalizable solution for enhancing sdAb functionality."

                "abstract": "Antibody-based therapies are at the forefront of modern medicine, addressing diverse challenges across oncology, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and beyond. The ability to design antibodies with enhanced functionality and specificity is critical for advancing next-generation therapeutics. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have propelled the field of antibody engineering, particularly through inverse folding models for Complementarity-Determining Region (CDR) sequence design. These models aim to generate novel antibody sequences that fold into desired structures with high antigen-binding affinity. However, current evaluation metrics, such as amino acid recovery rates, are limited in their ability to assess the structural and functional accuracy of designed sequences. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art inverse folding models\u2014ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF, LM-Design, and AntiFold\u2014using comprehensive datasets and alternative evaluation metrics like sequence similarity. By systematically analyzing recovery rates, mutation prediction capabilities, and amino acid composition biases, we identify strengths and limitations across models. AntiFold exhibits superior performance in Fab antibody design, whereas LM-Design demonstrates adaptability across diverse antibody types, including VHH antibodies. In contrast, models trained on general protein datasets (e.g., ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF) struggle with antibody-specific nuances. Key insights include the models\u2019 varying reliance on antigen structure and their distinct capabilities in capturing critical residues for antigen binding. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced training datasets, integration of functional data, and refined evaluation metrics to advance antibody design tools. By addressing these challenges, future models can unlock the full potential of AI-driven antibody engineering, paving the way for innovative therapeutic applications. ",

The ability to design antibodies with enhanced functionality and specificity is critical for advancing next-generation therapeutics. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have propelled the field of antibody engineering, particularly through inverse folding models for Complementarity-Determining Region (CDR) sequence design. These models aim to generate novel antibody sequences that fold into desired structures with high antigen-binding affinity. However, current evaluation metrics, such as amino acid recovery rates, are limited in their ability to assess the structural and functional accuracy of designed sequences. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art inverse folding models\u2014ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF, LM-Design, and AntiFold\u2014using comprehensive datasets and alternative evaluation metrics like sequence similarity. By systematically analyzing recovery rates, mutation prediction capabilities, and amino acid composition biases, we identify strengths and limitations across models. AntiFold exhibits superior performance in Fab antibody design, whereas LM-Design demonstrates adaptability across diverse antibody types, including VHH antibodies. In contrast, models trained on general protein datasets (e.g., ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF) struggle with antibody-specific nuances. Key insights include the models\u2019 varying reliance on antigen structure and their distinct capabilities in capturing critical residues for antigen binding. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced training datasets, integration of functional data, and refined evaluation metrics to advance antibody design tools. By addressing these challenges, future models can unlock the full potential of AI-driven antibody engineering, paving the way for innovative therapeutic applications. "

This has been possible because of significant advances in artificial intelligence methods and a surge in experimental datasets on antigen-antibody interaction. The ability of an antibody to bind an antigen with sufficient strength (measured by binding affinity, the inverse of the equilibrium dissociation constant) and specificity are critical properties in the design of neutralizing antibodies. Here we introduce Ab-Affinity, a new large language model in conjunction with a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing for diversity generation and fitness optimization, which can accurately predict the binding affinity of specific antibodies against a target peptide within the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. When trained on large datasets of existing antibodies that bind to certain antigens, we show that Ab-Affinity can generate novel antibodies with more than a 160-fold enhancement in binding affinities over those obtained experimentally. The predicted biophysical properties of the synthetic antibodies demonstrate their robustness. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation of the binding interactions of the best candidate synthetic antibodies showed enhanced interactions and stability on the target peptide epitope. In general, antibodies generated by Ab-Affinity appear to be superior to those obtained with other existing computational methods. ",

However, the design and discovery of early-stage antibody therapeutics remain a time and cost-intensive endeavor. In this work, we present an end-to-end Bayesian, language model-based method for designing large and diverse libraries of high-affinity single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). We integrate target-specific binding affinities with information from millions of natural protein sequences in a probabilistic machine learning framework to design thousands of scFvs that are then empirically measured. In a head-to-head comparison with a directed evolution approach, we show that the best scFv generated from our method represents a 28.8-fold improvement in binding over the best scFv from the directed evolution. Additionally, 99% of the designed scFvs in our most successful library are improvements over the initial candidate scFv. By comparing a library\u2019s predicted success to actual measurements, we demonstrate our method\u2019s ability to explore tradeoffs between library success and diversity during the design phase and prior to experimental testing. The results of our work highlight the significant impact machine learning models can have on scFv development. We expect our end-to-end method to be broadly applicable and able to provide value to other protein engineering tasks.",

However, the design and discovery of early-stage antibody therapeutics remain a time and cost-intensive endeavor. In this work, we present an end-to-end Bayesian, language model-based method for designing large and diverse libraries of high-affinity single-chain variable fragments (scFvs). We integrate target-specific binding affinities with information from millions of natural protein sequences in a probabilistic machine learning framework to design thousands of scFvs that are then empirically measured. In a head-to-head comparison with a directed evolution approach, we show that the best scFv generated from our method represents a 28.8-fold improvement in binding over the best scFv from the directed evolution. Additionally, 99% of the designed scFvs in our most successful library are improvements over the initial candidate scFv. By comparing a library\u2019s predicted success to actual measurements, we demonstrate our method\u2019s ability to explore tradeoffs between library success and diversity during the design phase and prior to experimental testing. The results of our work highlight the significant impact machine learning models can have on scFv development. We expect our end-to-end method to be broadly applicable and able to provide value to other protein engineering tasks."

Traditional methods, such as single-point mutations or combinatorial mutagenesis, are limited by the impracticality of exhaustively exploring the vast mutational space. To address this challenge, we developed a novel computational pipeline that integrates evolutionary constraints, antibody\u2013antigen-specific statistical potentials, molecular dynamics simulations, metadynamics, and a suite of deep learning models to identify affinity-enhancing mutations. Our deep learning framework includes MicroMutate, which predicts microenvironment-specific amino acid mutations, and graph-based models that evaluate postmutation antigen\u2013antibody-binding probabilities. Using this approach, we screened 12 single-point mutant antibodies targeting the hemagglutinin of the H7N9 avian influenza virus, starting from antibodies with initial affinities in the subnanomolar range, with one showing a 4.62-fold improvement. To demonstrate the generalizability of our method, we applied it to engineer an antibody against death receptor 5 with initial affinities in the subnanomolar range, successfully identifying a mutant with a 2.07-fold increase in affinity. Our work underscores the transformative potential of integrating deep learning and computational methods for rapidly and precisely discovering affinity-enhancing mutations while preserving immunogenicity and expression.

Antibody discovery is one of the most critical steps that determine the crucial properties of antibody drugs, such as efficacy, safety, and developability. Traditional methods based on mouse immunization have many drawbacks limiting drug discovery, which include long time periods, high costs, inability to target function-specific epitopes, unsuitable for low immunogenic and difficult-to-prepare antigens, the need to sacrifice mice, the need for further humanization to reduce immunogenicity, and so on. Here we report an antibody de novo design computational workflow that utilizes high-quality internally produced antibody data and advanced AI models. Using this workflow, we can de novo design antibodies that bind to user-specified functional epitopes with high affinity and specificity. Compared with classical wet-lab methods, the entire process is shortened from several months to several days and suitable for low immunogenicity and difficult-to-prepare antigens. It is particularly noteworthy that due to the use of humanized mouse-generated antibodies (Renlite bearing common light chain from Biocytogen) as training data for AI models, the designed antibodies have a high degree of humanization and good developability, effectively avoiding issues such as ADA and aggregation in subsequent processes. Methods First, with the help of Renlite, we comprehensively combined mouse immunization, B cell sorting with FACS, NGS single-cell sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis to internally generate a large amount of high-quality antibody sequence data. Second, we developed AI models for antigen-specific antibody selection and epitope prediction (bioRxiv, 2022: 2022.12. 22.521634.) to mine antigen-specific antibodies and corresponding antigen epitopes in the data. Based on the processed high-quality data, we trained an affinity prediction model that can accurately predict whether an antigen epitope and antibody sequence pair can bind to each other. Besides, using the sequence data, we trained an antibody sequence pre-training language model (bioRxiv, 2023: 2023.01. 19.524683.), which can generate high-quality antibody sequences to simulate the antibodies produced by mouse immunization. Finally, integrating the above AI models, we established an antibody de novo design computational workflow to simulate the biological process of antibody generation and affinity maturation in the mouse immune system, which can be seen as a \u201cDigitalMouse\u201d. Results In a test case, 1 million antibodies were designed aiming at binding to specific epitope of an antigen. 10 antibodies were selected and expressed. Binding affinity was determined using BLI. Two antibodies out of 10 had KD of 194 nM and 336 nM, respectively, with a concentration dependent signal increase on BLI. These antibodies have great potential as the starting point of candidate molecules for further in vitro, in vivo experimental validation and clinical trials. Conclusions The AI-based antibody de novo design workflow will revolutionize the antibody discovery industry paradigm, greatly shorten the antibody discovery phase, reduce R&amp;D costs, and expand antibody discovery to more antigen targets that are difficult with animal immunization. The computational workflow will have a profound impact on the entire biopharmaceutical industry. ",

                "abstract": "Abstract Antibody-based therapies are at the forefront of modern medicine, addressing diverse challenges across oncology, autoimmune diseases, infectious diseases, and beyond. The ability to design antibodies with enhanced functionality and specificity is critical for advancing next-generation therapeutics. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have propelled the field of antibody engineering, particularly through inverse folding models for Complementarity-Determining Region (CDR) sequence design. These models aim to generate novel antibody sequences that fold into desired structures with high antigen-binding affinity. However, current evaluation metrics, such as amino acid recovery rates, are limited in their ability to assess the structural and functional accuracy of designed sequences. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art inverse folding models\u2014ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF, LM-Design, and AntiFold\u2014using comprehensive datasets and alternative evaluation metrics like sequence similarity. By systematically analyzing recovery rates, mutation prediction capabilities, and amino acid composition biases, we identify strengths and limitations across models. AntiFold exhibits superior performance in Fab antibody design, particularly in variable regions like CDRH3, whereas LM-Design demonstrates adaptability across diverse antibody types, including VHH antibodies. In contrast, models trained on general protein datasets (e.g., ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF) struggle with antibody-specific nuances. Key insights include the models\u2019 varying reliance on antigen structure and their distinct capabilities in capturing critical residues for antigen binding. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced training datasets, integration of functional data, and refined evaluation metrics to advance antibody design tools. By addressing these challenges, future models can unlock the full potential of AI-driven antibody engineering, paving the way for innovative therapeutic applications. Author Summary Antibodies play a vital role in modern medicine, offering targeted therapies for diseases ranging from cancer to infectious diseases. Designing new antibodies with specific and enhanced functionalities remains a key challenge in advancing therapeutic applications. In this study, we benchmarked cutting-edge artificial intelligence models for antibody sequence design, focusing on their ability to generate sequences for the critical antigen-binding regions of antibodies, known as Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs). Our findings reveal that specialized models like AntiFold excel in designing human antibody fragments, particularly in complex regions, while other models such as LM-Design demonstrate versatility across different antibody types. Importantly, we identified the limitations of models trained on general protein datasets, highlighting the need for antibody-specific training data to capture the unique features critical for therapeutic effectiveness. By evaluating these models against robust datasets and diverse metrics, our work underscores the importance of improving training data and evaluation methods to advance AI-driven antibody design. These insights pave the way for more accurate and effective tools, ultimately supporting the development of next-generation antibody-based therapeutics. ",

The ability to design antibodies with enhanced functionality and specificity is critical for advancing next-generation therapeutics. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have propelled the field of antibody engineering, particularly through inverse folding models for Complementarity-Determining Region (CDR) sequence design. These models aim to generate novel antibody sequences that fold into desired structures with high antigen-binding affinity. However, current evaluation metrics, such as amino acid recovery rates, are limited in their ability to assess the structural and functional accuracy of designed sequences. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art inverse folding models\u2014ProteinMPNN, ESM-IF, LM-Design, and AntiFold\u2014using comprehensive datasets and alternative evaluation metrics like sequence similarity. By systematically analyzing recovery rates, mutation prediction capabilities, and amino acid composition biases, we identify strengths and limitations across models. AntiFold exhibits superior performance in Fab antibody design, particularly in variable regions like CDRH3, whereas LM-Design demonstrates adaptability across diverse antibody types, including VHH antibodies. In contrast, models trained on general protein datasets (e.g., ProteinMPNN and ESM-IF) struggle with antibody-specific nuances. Key insights include the models\u2019 varying reliance on antigen structure and their distinct capabilities in capturing critical residues for antigen binding. Our findings highlight the need for enhanced training datasets, integration of functional data, and refined evaluation metrics to advance antibody design tools. By addressing these challenges, future models can unlock the full potential of AI-driven antibody engineering, paving the way for innovative therapeutic applications. Author Summary Antibodies play a vital role in modern medicine, offering targeted therapies for diseases ranging from cancer to infectious diseases. Designing new antibodies with specific and enhanced functionalities remains a key challenge in advancing therapeutic applications. In this study, we benchmarked cutting-edge artificial intelligence models for antibody sequence design, focusing on their ability to generate sequences for the critical antigen-binding regions of antibodies, known as Complementarity-Determining Regions (CDRs). Our findings reveal that specialized models like AntiFold excel in designing human antibody fragments, particularly in complex regions, while other models such as LM-Design demonstrate versatility across different antibody types. Importantly, we identified the limitations of models trained on general protein datasets, highlighting the need for antibody-specific training data to capture the unique features critical for therapeutic effectiveness. By evaluating these models against robust datasets and diverse metrics, our work underscores the importance of improving training data and evaluation methods to advance AI-driven antibody design. These insights pave the way for more accurate and effective tools, ultimately supporting the development of next-generation antibody-based therapeutics. "

The specificity of an antibody is determined by its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are located in the variable domains of the antibody chains and form the antigen-binding site. Previous studies have utilized complex techniques to generate CDRs, but they suffer from inadequate geometric modeling. Moreover, the common iterative refinement strategies lead to an inefficient inference. In this paper, we propose a \\textit{simple yet effective} model that can co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of CDRs in a one-shot manner. To achieve this, we decouple the antibody CDR design problem into two stages: (i) geometric modeling of protein complex structures and (ii) sequence-structure co-learning. We develop a novel macromolecular structure invariant embedding, typically for protein complexes, that captures both intra- and inter-component interactions among the backbone atoms, including C$\\alpha$, N, C, and O atoms, to achieve comprehensive geometric modeling. Then, we introduce a simple cross-gate MLP for sequence-structure co-learning, allowing sequence and structure representations to implicitly refine each other. This enables our model to design desired sequences and structures in a one-shot manner. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our results at both the sequence and structure level, which demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art antibody CDR design methods.

We present a computational pipeline for the discovery and design of therapeutic antibody candidates, which incorporates physics- and AI-based methods for the generation, assessment, and validation of developable candidate antibodies against diverse epitopes, via efficient few-shot experimental screens. We demonstrate that these orthogonal methods can lead to promising designs. We evaluated our approach by experimentally testing a small number of candidates against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants in three different tasks: (i) traversing sequence landscapes of binders, we identify highly sequence dissimilar antibodies that retain binding to the Wuhan strain, (ii) rescuing binding from escape mutations, we show up to 54% of designs gain binding affinity to a new subvariant and (iii) improving developability characteristics of antibodies while retaining binding properties. These results together demonstrate an end-to-end antibody design pipeline with applicability across a wide range of antibody design tasks. We experimentally characterised binding against different antigen targets, developability profiles, and cryo-EM structures of designed antibodies. Our work demonstrates how combined AI and physics computational methods improve productivity and viability of antibody designs. ",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Developing therapeutic antibodies is a challenging endeavour, often requiring large-scale screening to produce initial binders, that still often require optimisation for developability. We present a computational pipeline for the discovery and design of therapeutic antibody candidates, which incorporates physics- and AI-based methods for the generation, assessment, and validation of developable candidate antibodies against diverse epitopes, via efficient few-shot experimental screens. We demonstrate that these orthogonal methods can lead to promising designs. We evaluated our approach by experimentally testing a small number of candidates against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants in three different tasks: (i) traversing sequence landscapes of binders, we identify highly sequence dissimilar antibodies that retain binding to the Wuhan strain, (ii) rescuing binding from escape mutations, we show up to 54% of designs gain binding affinity to a new subvariant and (iii) improving developability characteristics of antibodies while retaining binding properties. These results together demonstrate an end-to-end antibody design pipeline with applicability across a wide range of antibody design tasks. We experimentally characterised binding against different antigen targets, developability profiles, and cryo-EM structures of designed antibodies. Our work demonstrates how combined AI and physics computational methods improve productivity and viability of antibody designs. "

To deliver a potentially immediate and lasting treatment to current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, new collaborations and ways of sharing are required to create as many paths forward as possible. Here, we leverage our expertise in computational antibody engineering to rationally design/engineer three previously reported SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and share our proposal towards anti-SARS-CoV-2 biologics therapeutics. SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, m396, 80R and CR-3022 were chosen as templates due to their diversified epitopes and confirmed neutralization potency against SARS-CoV (but not SARS-CoV-2 except for CR3022). Structures of variable fragment (Fv) in complex with receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 were subjected to our established in silico antibody engineering platform to improve their binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 and developability profiles. The selected top mutations were ensembled into a focused library for each antibody for further screening. In addition, we convert the selected binders with different epitopes into the trispecific format, aiming to increase potency and to prevent mutational escape. Lastly, to avoid antibody-induced virus activation or enhancement, we suggest application of NNAS and DQ mutations to the Fc region to eliminate effector functions and extend half-life.",

To deliver a potentially immediate and lasting treatment to current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, new collaborations and ways of sharing are required to create as many paths forward as possible. Here, we leverage our expertise in computational antibody engineering to rationally design/engineer three previously reported SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and share our proposal towards anti-SARS-CoV-2 biologics therapeutics. SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, m396, 80R and CR-3022 were chosen as templates due to their diversified epitopes and confirmed neutralization potency against SARS-CoV (but not SARS-CoV-2 except for CR3022). Structures of variable fragment (Fv) in complex with receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 were subjected to our established in silico antibody engineering platform to improve their binding affinity to SARS-CoV-2 and developability profiles. The selected top mutations were ensembled into a focused library for each antibody for further screening. In addition, we convert the selected binders with different epitopes into the trispecific format, aiming to increase potency and to prevent mutational escape. Lastly, to avoid antibody-induced virus activation or enhancement, we suggest application of NNAS and DQ mutations to the Fc region to eliminate effector functions and extend half-life."

Recently, deep learning-based computational antibody design has attracted popular attention since it automatically mines the antibody patterns from data that could be complementary to human experiences. However, the computational methods heavily rely on high-quality antibody structure data, which is quite limited. Besides, the complementarity-determining region (CDR), which is the key component of an antibody that determines the specificity and binding affinity, is highly variable and hard to predict. Therefore, the data limitation issue further raises the difficulty of CDR generation for antibodies. Fortunately, there exists a large amount of sequence data of antibodies that can help model the CDR and alleviate the reliance on structure data. By witnessing the success of pre-training models for protein modeling, in this paper, we develop the antibody pre-training language model and incorporate it into the (antigen-specific) antibody design model in a systemic way. Specifically, we first pre-train an antibody language model based on the sequence data, then propose a one-shot way for sequence and structure generation of CDR to avoid the heavy cost and error propagation from an autoregressive manner, and finally leverage the pre-trained antibody model for the antigen-specific antibody generation model with some carefully designed modules. Through various experiments, we show that our method achieves superior performances over previous baselines on different tasks, such as sequence and structure generation and antigen-binding CDR-H3 design.

                "abstract": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to greatly increase the speed, quality and controllability of antibody design. Traditional de novo antibody discovery requires time and resource intensive screening of large immune or synthetic libraries. These methods also offer little control over the output sequences, which can result in lead candidates with sub-optimal binding and poor developability attributes. Several groups have introduced models for generative antibody design with promising in silico evidence [1\u201310], however, no such method has demonstrated generative AI-based de novo antibody design with experimental validation. Here we use generative deep learning models to de novo design antibodies against three distinct targets, in a zero-shot fashion, where all designs are the result of a single round of model generations with no follow-up optimization. In particular, we screen over 1 million antibody variants designed for binding to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) using our high-throughput wet lab capabilities. Our models successfully design all CDRs in the heavy chain of the antibody and compute likelihoods that are calibrated with binding. We achieve binding rates of 10.6% and 1.8% for heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3) and HCDR123 designs respectively, which is four and eleven times higher than HCDR3s and HCDR123s randomly sampled from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) [11]. We further characterize 421 AI-designed binders using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), finding three that bind tighter than the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab. The binders are highly diverse, have low sequence identity to known antibodies, and adopt variable structural conformations. Additionally, the binders score highly on our previously introduced Naturalness metric [12], indicating they are likely to possess desirable developability profiles and low immunogenicity. We open source1 the HER2 binders and report the measured binding affinities. These results unlock a path to accelerated drug creation for novel therapeutic targets using generative AI and high-throughput experimentation.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to greatly increase the speed, quality and controllability of antibody design. Traditional de novo antibody discovery requires time and resource intensive screening of large immune or synthetic libraries. These methods also offer little control over the output sequences, which can result in lead candidates with sub-optimal binding and poor developability attributes. Several groups have introduced models for generative antibody design with promising in silico evidence [1\u201310], however, no such method has demonstrated generative AI-based de novo antibody design with experimental validation. Here we use generative deep learning models to de novo design antibodies against three distinct targets, in a zero-shot fashion, where all designs are the result of a single round of model generations with no follow-up optimization. In particular, we screen over 1 million antibody variants designed for binding to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) using our high-throughput wet lab capabilities. Our models successfully design all CDRs in the heavy chain of the antibody and compute likelihoods that are calibrated with binding. We achieve binding rates of 10.6% and 1.8% for heavy chain CDR3 (HCDR3) and HCDR123 designs respectively, which is four and eleven times higher than HCDR3s and HCDR123s randomly sampled from the Observed Antibody Space (OAS) [11]. We further characterize 421 AI-designed binders using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), finding three that bind tighter than the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab. The binders are highly diverse, have low sequence identity to known antibodies, and adopt variable structural conformations. Additionally, the binders score highly on our previously introduced Naturalness metric [12], indicating they are likely to possess desirable developability profiles and low immunogenicity. We open source1 the HER2 binders and report the measured binding affinities. These results unlock a path to accelerated drug creation for novel therapeutic targets using generative AI and high-throughput experimentation."

In nanobody-antigen structure prediction, SAGERank, coupled with a protein dynamics structure prediction algorithm, slightly outperforms Alphafold3. Most importantly, our study demonstrates the real potential of inductive deep learning to overcome the small dataset problem in molecular science. The SAGERank models trained for antibody-antigen docking can be used to examine general protein-protein interaction tasks, such as T Cell Receptor-peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex (TCR-pMHC) recognition, classification of biological ",

In nanobody-antigen structure prediction, SAGERank, coupled with a protein dynamics structure prediction algorithm, slightly outperforms Alphafold3. Most importantly, our study demonstrates the real potential of inductive deep learning to overcome the small dataset problem in molecular science.

De novo generation of new antibodies that target specific antigens holds the key to accelerating vaccine discovery. However, this co-design of the amino acid sequence and the 3D structure subsumes and accentuates some central challenges from multiple tasks, including protein folding (sequence to structure), inverse folding (structure to sequence), and docking (binding). We strive to surmount these challenges with a new generative model AbODE that extends graph PDEs to accommodate both contextual information and external interactions. Unlike existing approaches, AbODE uses a single round of full-shot decoding and elicits continuous differential attention that encapsulates and evolves with latent interactions within the antibody as well as those involving the antigen. We unravel fundamental connections between AbODE and temporal networks as well as graph-matching networks. The proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods on standard metrics across benchmarks.",

De novo generation of new antibodies that target specific antigens holds the key to accelerating vaccine discovery. However, this co-design of the amino acid sequence and the 3D structure subsumes and accentuates some central challenges from multiple tasks, including protein folding (sequence to structure), inverse folding (structure to sequence), and docking (binding). We strive to surmount these challenges with a new generative model AbODE that extends graph PDEs to accommodate both contextual information and external interactions. Unlike existing approaches, AbODE uses a single round of full-shot decoding and elicits continuous differential attention that encapsulates and evolves with latent interactions within the antibody as well as those involving the antigen. We unravel fundamental connections between AbODE and temporal networks as well as graph-matching networks. The proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods on standard metrics across benchmarks."

                "abstract": "Antibodies safeguard our health through their precise and potent binding to specific antigens, demonstrating promising therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of numerous diseases, including COVID-19. Recent advancements in biomedical language models have shown the great potential to interpret complex biological structures and functions. However, existing antibody specific models have a notable limitation that they lack explicit consideration for antibody structural information, despite the fact that both 1D sequence and 3D structure carry unique and complementary insights into antibody behavior and functionality. This paper proposes Sequence-Structure multi-level pre-trained Antibody Language Model (S$^2$ALM), combining holistic sequential and structural information in one unified, generic antibody foundation model. We construct a hierarchical pre-training paradigm incorporated with two customized multi-level training objectives to facilitate the modeling of comprehensive antibody representations. S$^2$ALM's representation space uncovers inherent functional binding mechanisms, biological evolution properties and structural interaction patterns. Pre-trained over 75 million sequences and 11.7 million structures, S$^2$ALM can be adopted for diverse downstream tasks: accurately predicting antigen-antibody binding affinities, precisely distinguishing B cell maturation stages, identifying antibody crucial binding positions, and specifically designing novel coronavirus-binding antibodies. Remarkably, S$^2$ALM outperforms well-established and renowned baselines and sets new state-of-the-art performance across extensive antibody specific understanding and generation tasks. S$^2$ALM's ability to model comprehensive and generalized representations further positions its potential to advance real-world therapeutic antibody development, potentially addressing unmet academic, industrial, and clinical needs.

                "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the promise of monoclonal antibody-based prophylactic and therapeutic drugs1\u20133, but also revealed how quickly viral escape can curtail effective options4, 5. With the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in late 2021, many clinically used antibody drug products lost potency, including EvusheldTM and its constituent, cilgavimab4, 6. Cilgavimab, like its progenitor COV2-2130, is a class 3 antibody that is compatible with other antibodies in combination4 and is challenging to replace with existing approaches. Rapidly modifying such high-value antibodies with a known clinical profile to restore efficacy against emerging variants is a compelling mitigation strategy. We sought to redesign COV2-2130 to rescue in vivo efficacy against Omicron BA.1 and BA.1.1 strains while maintaining efficacy against the contemporaneously dominant Delta variant. Here we show that our computationally redesigned antibody, 2130-1-0114-112, achieves this objective, simultaneously increases neutralization potency against Delta and many variants of concern that subsequently emerged, and provides protection in vivo against the strains tested, WA1/2020, BA.1.1, and BA.5. Deep mutational scanning of tens of thousands pseudovirus variants reveals 2130-1-0114-112 improves broad potency without incurring additional escape liabilities. Our results suggest that computational approaches can optimize an antibody to target multiple escape variants, while simultaneously enriching potency. Because our approach is computationally driven, not requiring experimental iterations or pre-existing binding data, it could enable rapid response strategies to address escape variants or pre-emptively mitigate escape vulnerabilities.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the promise of monoclonal antibody-based prophylactic and therapeutic drugs1\u20133, but also revealed how quickly viral escape can curtail effective options4, 5. With the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant in late 2021, many clinically used antibody drug products lost potency, including EvusheldTM and its constituent, cilgavimab4, 6. Cilgavimab, like its progenitor COV2-2130, is a class 3 antibody that is compatible with other antibodies in combination4 and is challenging to replace with existing approaches. Rapidly modifying such high-value antibodies with a known clinical profile to restore efficacy against emerging variants is a compelling mitigation strategy. We sought to redesign COV2-2130 to rescue in vivo efficacy against Omicron BA.1 and BA.1.1 strains while maintaining efficacy against the contemporaneously dominant Delta variant. Here we show that our computationally redesigned antibody, 2130-1-0114-112, achieves this objective, simultaneously increases neutralization potency against Delta and many variants of concern that subsequently emerged, and provides protection in vivo against the strains tested, WA1/2020, BA.1.1, and BA.5. Deep mutational scanning of tens of thousands pseudovirus variants reveals 2130-1-0114-112 improves broad potency without incurring additional escape liabilities. Our results suggest that computational approaches can optimize an antibody to target multiple escape variants, while simultaneously enriching potency. Because our approach is computationally driven, not requiring experimental iterations or pre-existing binding data, it could enable rapid response strategies to address escape variants or pre-emptively mitigate escape vulnerabilities."

                "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a global health threat, for which no licensed antiviral treatment has been available. In this study, we employed in silico approaches to optimize monoclonal antibodies targeting the Zika virus envelope protein (ZIKV E) in the Domain III (DIII) region, which is crucial for receptor binding and virus entry. A high-resolution crystal structure of ZIKV E in complex with the neutralizing antibody ZV-64 was used as a template for designing a library of antibody variants through targeted double-point mutations. The variants were systematically evaluated for stability, binding affinity, solubility, and protein-protein interaction potential using FoldX, DeepPurpose, SoluProt, and molecular docking. Among all the mutants, Variants-213 and -206 were identified as the top candidates, exhibiting the most favorable predicted binding affinity and solubility compared to the control antibody. The molecular dynamics simulations further revealed the structural stability of the two mutant variants, in which Variant-206 showed a predicted binding energy (-76.90\u00a0kcal/mol) along with higher conformational flexibilities. The findings demonstrate the use of computational antibody engineering to identify potentially high-affinity therapeutics against ZIKV, providing a foundation for future experimental validation and therapeutic development against ZIKV.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a global health threat, for which no licensed antiviral treatment has been available. In this study, we employed in silico approaches to optimize monoclonal antibodies targeting the Zika virus envelope protein (ZIKV E) in the Domain III (DIII) region, which is crucial for receptor binding and virus entry. A high-resolution crystal structure of ZIKV E in complex with the neutralizing antibody ZV-64 was used as a template for designing a library of antibody variants through targeted double-point mutations. The variants were systematically evaluated for stability, binding affinity, solubility, and protein-protein interaction potential using FoldX, DeepPurpose, SoluProt, and molecular docking. Among all the mutants, Variants-213 and -206 were identified as the top candidates, exhibiting the most favorable predicted binding affinity and solubility compared to the control antibody. The molecular dynamics simulations further revealed the structural stability of the two mutant variants, in which Variant-206 showed a predicted binding energy (-76.90\u00a0kcal/mol) along with higher conformational flexibilities. The findings demonstrate the use of computational antibody engineering to identify potentially high-affinity therapeutics against ZIKV, providing a foundation for future experimental validation and therapeutic development against ZIKV."

Unsupervised algorithms trained on massive and diverse protein sequence datasets facilitate the prediction of panels of antibody variants with native-like intrinsic properties (e.g., high stability), greatly reducing the amount of subsequent experimentation needed to identify specific candidates that also possess desired extrinsic properties (e.g., high affinity). Additionally, supervised algorithms, which are trained on deep sequencing datasets obtained after enrichment of in vitro antibody libraries for one or more specific extrinsic properties, enable the prediction of antibody variants with desired combinations of extrinsic properties without the need for additional screening. Here we review recent advances using both machine learning approaches and how they are impacting the field of antibody engineering as well as key outstanding challenges and opportunities for these paradigm-changing methods.

The specificity of an antibody is determined by its complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which are located in the variable domains of the antibody chains and form the antigen-binding site. Previous studies have utilized complex techniques to generate CDRs, but they suffer from inadequate geometric modeling. Moreover, the common iterative refinement strategies lead to an inefficient inference. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective model that can co-design 1D sequences and 3D structures of CDRs in a one-shot manner. To achieve this, we decouple the antibody CDR design problem into two stages: (i) geometric modeling of protein complex structures and (ii) sequence-structure co-learning. We develop a novel macromolecular structure invariant embedding, typically for protein complexes, that captures both intra- and inter-component interactions among the backbone atoms, including Calpha, N, C, and O atoms, to achieve comprehensive geometric modeling. Then, we introduce a simple cross-gate MLP for sequence-structure co-learning, allowing sequence and structure representations to implicitly refine each other. This enables our model to design desired sequences and structures in a one-shot manner. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate our results at both the sequence and structure level, which demonstrate that our model achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art antibody CDR design methods.

The application of computational strategies is pivotal for refining the efficacy of protein binders like nanobodies by broadening the sequence diversity, forecasting and bolstering their binding potency, selectivity, and overall performance. Recent advancements in computational techniques, such as machine learning algorithms and physics-based molecular modeling have significantly improved the design and development of nanobodies. These techniques allow for the precise modeling of nanobody-target interactions, enabling the identification of key residues responsible for binding and the prediction of potential conformational changes. In this study, five parental nanobodies binding to GPCRs and transporters were first used as template to create in silico nanobody libraries with the SCHEMA algorithm. Then, their binding potential and function to GPCRs or transporters were predicted by pre-trained machine learning models. The sequences above a threshold were processed with Rosetta and AlphaFold2 for 3D structural predictions. To further identify optimal conformations of specific nanobodies theoretically binding to 5-HT1AR or SERT, protein-protein docking by RosettaDock were performed. Finally, based on these model complexes, new nanobodies were redesigned, resulting in 21 and 18 candidates with enhanced binding to 5-HT1AR and SERT, respectively.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Design of nanobodies have emerged as a new trend in antibody engineering, leveraging their unique properties including high stability, solubility, and the ability to bind to challenging targets such as membrane proteins. The application of computational strategies is pivotal for refining the efficacy of protein binders like nanobodies by broadening the sequence diversity, forecasting and bolstering their binding potency, selectivity, and overall performance. Recent advancements in computational techniques, such as machine learning algorithms and physics-based molecular modeling have significantly improved the design and development of nanobodies. These techniques allow for the precise modeling of nanobody-target interactions, enabling the identification of key residues responsible for binding and the prediction of potential conformational changes. In this study, five parental nanobodies binding to GPCRs and transporters were first used as template to create in silico nanobody libraries with the SCHEMA algorithm. Then, their binding potential and function to GPCRs or transporters were predicted by pre-trained machine learning models. The sequences above a threshold were processed with Rosetta and AlphaFold2 for 3D structural predictions. To further identify optimal conformations of specific nanobodies theoretically binding to 5-HT1AR or SERT, protein-protein docking by RosettaDock were performed. Finally, based on these model complexes, new nanobodies were redesigned, resulting in 21 and 18 candidates with enhanced binding to 5-HT1AR and SERT, respectively."

Recently, deep learning-based computational antibody design has attracted popular attention since it automatically mines the antibody patterns from data that could be complementary to human experiences. However, the computational methods heavily rely on the high-quality antibody structure data, which is quite limited. Besides, the complementarity-determining region (CDR), which is the key component of an antibody that determines the specificity and binding affinity, is highly variable and hard to predict. Therefore, data limitation issue further raises the difficulty of CDR generation for antibodies. Fortunately, there exists a large amount of sequence data of antibodies that can help model the CDR and alleviate the reliance on structured data. By witnessing the success of pre-training models for protein modeling, in this paper, we develop an antibody pre-trained language model and incorporate it into the (antigen-specific) antibody design model in a systemic way. Specifically, we first pre-train an antibody language model based on the sequence data, then propose a one-shot way for sequence and structure generation of CDR to avoid the heavy cost and error propagation from an autoregressive manner, and finally leverage the pre-trained antibody model for the antigen-specific antibody generation model with some carefully designed modules. Through various experiments, we show that our method achieves superior performance over previous baselines on different tasks, such as sequence and structure generation, antigen-binding CDR-H3 design.",

Conventional ADC development has primarily relied on empirical screening and structure-based design, often limited by incomplete structural information, non-systematic linker\u2013payload selection, and constraints in experimental throughput. Computational methods, including artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are increasingly being integrated into ADC discovery and optimization workflows (i.e., AI-driven ADC Design) to address these limitations. This review is organized into six sections: (1) the progression from traditional modeling approaches to AI-driven design of individual ADC components; (2) the application of deep learning (DL) to antibody structure prediction and identification of optimal conjugation sites; (3) the use of AI/ML models for forecasting pharmacokinetic properties and toxicity profiles; (4) emerging generative algorithms for antibody sequence diversification and affinity optimization; (5) case studies demonstrating the integration of computational tools with experimental pipelines, including systems that link in silico predictions to high-throughput validation; and (6) persistent challenges, including data sparsity, model interpretability, validation complexity, and regulatory considerations. The review concludes with a discussion of future directions, emphasizing the role of multimodal data integration, reinforcement learning (RL), and closed-loop design frameworks to support iterative ADC development.

Protein display and directed evolution systems have transformed synthetic Ab discovery, engineering, and optimization, vastly expanding the number of Ab clones able to be experimentally screened for binding. Moreover, the burgeoning integration of high-throughput screening, deep sequencing, and machine learning has further augmented in\u00a0vitro Ab optimization, promising to accelerate the design process and massively expand the Ab sequence space interrogated. In this Brief Review, we discuss the experimental and computational tools employed in synthetic Ab engineering and optimization. We also explore the therapeutic challenges posed by developing Abs for infectious diseases, and the prospects for leveraging machine learning-guided protein engineering to prospectively design Abs resistant to viral escape."

Pharmaceutically focused computational methods support the assessment of antibody immunogenicity and biophysical properties. However, structure-based antibody design has been curbed by the lack of accurate antibody and antigen structures \u2013 until the emergence of machine learning (ML)-based methods capable of utilizing large data volumes. This chapter provides an overview of the applications of artificial intelligence and its subsets, ML and deep learning, in antibody discovery and development, covering the available databases and models for structure prediction, binding prediction, and developability, with special attention paid to the usage of language models for antibody design.

                "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent a major class of therapeutics with widespread clinical applications in oncology, immunology, hematology, neurology and infectious disease. Since the introduction of hybridoma technology in 1975, the field has been advanced by a succession of innovations including chimeric and humanized antibody engineering, phage display, transgenic mouse platforms and high-throughput single B cell isolation. These technological developments have enhanced the specificity, potency and safety of mAbs, resulting in 144 FDA-approved antibody drugs on the market and 1,516 worldwide candidates in clinical development as of August 2025. Engineering breakthroughs have led to new modalities of antibody-based therapeutics, such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies. Each of these modalities has therapeutic utility across multiple disease domains. Recent advances in delivery strategies, notably mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and antibody-directed in vivo CAR-T cell reprogramming, can enable precision therapies while reducing off-target effects and manufacturing complexity. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and structural modeling tools has further accelerated antibody discovery, affinity maturation and immunogenicity prediction, allowing for more efficient and rational antibody design. The advances in antibody technology are reflected in the rapid market growth of antibody-based therapeutics, which had global sales exceeding USD 267 billion in 2024. This review provides a comprehensive update on recent developments in antibody discovery platforms, therapeutic formats and market trends, highlighting emerging strategies that are reshaping the landscape of antibody-based medicine. Furthermore, we discuss clinical translation, regulatory landscapes, and the integration of engineering, biology and informatics. Together, these aspects shape a dynamic and multidisciplinary future for the therapeutic antibody field, which is poised to address unmet clinical needs and global healthcare priorities.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent a major class of therapeutics with widespread clinical applications in oncology, immunology, hematology, neurology and infectious disease. Since the introduction of hybridoma technology in 1975, the field has been advanced by a succession of innovations including chimeric and humanized antibody engineering, phage display, transgenic mouse platforms and high-throughput single B cell isolation. These technological developments have enhanced the specificity, potency and safety of mAbs, resulting in 144 FDA-approved antibody drugs on the market and 1,516 worldwide candidates in clinical development as of August 2025. Engineering breakthroughs have led to new modalities of antibody-based therapeutics, such as antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), bispecific antibodies (bsAbs), and chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapies. Each of these modalities has therapeutic utility across multiple disease domains. Recent advances in delivery strategies, notably mRNA-lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and antibody-directed in vivo CAR-T cell reprogramming, can enable precision therapies while reducing off-target effects and manufacturing complexity. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), next-generation sequencing (NGS), and structural modeling tools has further accelerated antibody discovery, affinity maturation and immunogenicity prediction, allowing for more efficient and rational antibody design. The advances in antibody technology are reflected in the rapid market growth of antibody-based therapeutics, which had global sales exceeding USD 267 billion in 2024. This review provides a comprehensive update on recent developments in antibody discovery platforms, therapeutic formats and market trends, highlighting emerging strategies that are reshaping the landscape of antibody-based medicine. Furthermore, we discuss clinical translation, regulatory landscapes, and the integration of engineering, biology and informatics. Together, these aspects shape a dynamic and multidisciplinary future for the therapeutic antibody field, which is poised to address unmet clinical needs and global healthcare priorities."

For instance, in recent years, antibodies have emerged as an important class of therapeutics against a spectrum of pathologies. In cancer, immune-inspired approaches are witnessing a surge thanks to a better understanding of tumor-associated antigens and the mechanisms of their engagement or evasion from the human immune system. Here, we provide a summary of the main state-of-the-art computational approaches that are used to design antibodies and antigens, and in parallel, we review key methodologies for epitope identification for both B- and T-cell mediated responses. A special focus is devoted to the description of structure- and physics-based models, privileged over purely sequence-based approaches. We discuss the implications of novel methods in engineering biomolecules with tailored immunological properties for possible therapeutic uses. Finally, we highlight the extraordinary challenges and opportunities presented by the possible integration of structure- and physics-based methods with emerging Artificial Intelligence technologies for the prediction and design of novel antigens, epitopes, and antibodies.

Conventional single-cell sorting technology is a powerful method for antibody discovery, effectively producing human mAbs; however, it remains expensive and limits the number of cells available for analysis. Furthermore, sorting hundreds of B cells may not yield cells encoding antibodies with high neutralizing potency since several unexpected antibodies, such as autoantibodies and infectivity-enhancing antibodies, can be included in antigen-specific B cells in patients with infectious diseases. The preparation of antibodies for infectious diseases, such as that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with rapid mutations, requires discovery technology to generate and select diverse human mAb libraries.

Conventional single-cell sorting technology is a powerful method for antibody discovery, effectively producing human mAbs; however, it remains expensive and limits the number of cells available for analysis. Furthermore, sorting hundreds of B cells may not yield cells encoding antibodies with high neutralizing potency since several unexpected antibodies, such as autoantibodies and infectivity-enhancing antibodies, can be included in antigen-specific B cells in patients with infectious diseases. The preparation of antibodies for infectious diseases, such as that caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with rapid mutations, requires discovery technology to generate and select diverse human mAb libraries.

                "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is a key technology to enable accurate prediction of antibody-antigen binding, a prerequisite for in silico vaccine and antibody design. Two orthogonal problems hinder the current application of ML to antibody-specificity prediction and the benchmarking thereof: (i) The lack of a unified formalized mapping of immunological antibody specificity prediction problems into ML notation and (ii) the unavailability of large-scale training datasets. Here, we developed the Absolut! software suite that allows the parameter-based unconstrained generation of synthetic lattice-based 3D-antibody-antigen binding structures with ground-truth access to conformational paratope, epitope, and affinity. We show that Absolut!-generated datasets recapitulate critical biological sequence and structural features that render antibody-antigen binding prediction challenging. To demonstrate the immediate, high-throughput, and large-scale applicability of Absolut!, we have created an online database of 1 billion antibody-antigen structures, the extension of which is only constrained by moderate computational resources. We translated immunological antibody specificity prediction problems into ML tasks and used our database to investigate paratope-epitope binding prediction accuracy as a function of structural information encoding, dataset size, and ML method, which is unfeasible with existing experimental data. Furthermore, we found that in silico investigated conditions, predicted to increase antibody specificity prediction accuracy, align with and extend conclusions drawn from experimental antibody-antigen structural data.

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Machine learning (ML) is a key technology to enable accurate prediction of antibody-antigen binding, a prerequisite for in silico vaccine and antibody design. Two orthogonal problems hinder the current application of ML to antibody-specificity prediction and the benchmarking thereof: (i) The lack of a unified formalized mapping of immunological antibody specificity prediction problems into ML notation and (ii) the unavailability of large-scale training datasets. Here, we developed the Absolut! software suite that allows the parameter-based unconstrained generation of synthetic lattice-based 3D-antibody-antigen binding structures with ground-truth access to conformational paratope, epitope, and affinity. We show that Absolut!-generated datasets recapitulate critical biological sequence and structural features that render antibody-antigen binding prediction challenging. To demonstrate the immediate, high-throughput, and large-scale applicability of Absolut!, we have created an online database of 1 billion antibody-antigen structures, the extension of which is only constrained by moderate computational resources. We translated immunological antibody specificity prediction problems into ML tasks and used our database to investigate paratope-epitope binding prediction accuracy as a function of structural information encoding, dataset size, and ML method, which is unfeasible with existing experimental data. Furthermore, we found that in silico investigated conditions, predicted to increase antibody specificity prediction accuracy, align with and extend conclusions drawn from experimental antibody-antigen structural data. In summary, the Absolut! framework enables the development and benchmarking of ML strategies for biotherapeutics discovery and design.

Identifying productive VH - VL combinations experimentally is labor-intensive and costly, motivating the development of computational methods that can more efficiently predict compatible heavy - light chain pairs. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework that includes a new benchmark dataset and three deep learning models, each trained with a different negative sampling strategy: random pairing, V-gene mismatching, and full V(D)J germline mismatching. Our dataset includes natural pairs and these three types of synthetic negatives to simulate increasingly realistic biological constraints. Furthermore, we present a lightweight yet highly effective BERT-based model that achieves over 90% accuracy in discriminating natural from synthetic VH - VL pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that V(D)J-informed negative sampling significantly improves model generalization and biological interpretability. By providing reproducible baselines and a biologically grounded benchmark, this work lays the foundation for future development of efficient computational tools in antibody engineering.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chain pairing is a critical determinant of antibody diversity, stability, and antigen-binding specificity. Identifying productive VH - VL combinations experimentally is labor-intensive and costly, motivating the development of computational methods that can more efficiently predict compatible heavy - light chain pairs. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework that includes a new benchmark dataset and three deep learning models, each trained with a different negative sampling strategy: random pairing, V-gene mismatching, and full V(D)J germline mismatching. Our dataset includes natural pairs and these three types of synthetic negatives to simulate increasingly realistic biological constraints. Furthermore, we present a lightweight yet highly effective BERT-based model that achieves over 90% accuracy in discriminating natural from synthetic VH - VL pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that V(D)J-informed negative sampling significantly improves model generalization and biological interpretability. By providing reproducible baselines and a biologically grounded benchmark, this work lays the foundation for future development of efficient computational tools in antibody engineering."

Here, we establish a synthetic coevolution system combining high-throughput screening of antibody and RBD variant libraries with protein mutagenesis, surface display, and deep sequencing. Additionally, to significantly extend our interrogation of sequence space, we train a protein language model that predicts antibody escape to RBD variants and demonstrate its capability to generalize to a larger mutational load and mutations at positions unseen during training. Through explainable AI techniques, we probe the model and identify biologically meaningful coevolution trends. Synthetic coevolution reveals antagonistic and compensatory mutational trajectories of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 variants, enhancing the understanding of this evolutionary conflict.",

Here, we establish a synthetic coevolution system combining high-throughput screening of antibody and RBD variant libraries with protein mutagenesis, surface display, and deep sequencing. Additionally, to significantly extend our interrogation of sequence space, we train a protein language model that predicts antibody escape to RBD variants and demonstrate its capability to generalize to a larger mutational load and mutations at positions unseen during training. Through explainable AI techniques, we probe the model and identify biologically meaningful coevolution trends. Synthetic coevolution reveals antagonistic and compensatory mutational trajectories of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 variants, enhancing the understanding of this evolutionary conflict."

                "abstract": "Therapeutic antibodies make up a rapidly growing segment of the biologics market. However, rational design of antibodies is hindered by reliance on experimental methods for determining antibody structures. In recent years, deep learning methods have driven significant advances in general protein structure prediction. Here, we present DeepAb, a deep learning method for predicting accurate antibody FV structures from sequence. We evaluate DeepAb on two benchmark sets \u2013 one balanced for structural diversity and the other composed of clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies \u2013 and find that our method consistently outperforms the leading alternatives. Previous deep learning methods have operated as \u201cblack boxes\u201d and offered few insights into their predictions. By introducing a directly interpretable attention mechanism, we show that our network attends to physically important residue pairs. For example, in prediction of one CDR H3 residue conformation, the network attends to proximal aromatics and a key hydrogen bonding interaction that constrain the loop conformation. Finally, we present a novel mutant scoring metric derived from network confidence and show that for a particular antibody, all eight of the top-ranked mutations improve binding affinity. These results suggest that this model will be useful for a broad range of antibody prediction and design tasks. Significance Accurate structure models are critical for understanding the properties of potential therapeutic antibodies. Conventional methods for protein structure determination require significant investments of time and resources and may fail. Although greatly improved, methods for general protein structure prediction still cannot consistently provide the accuracy necessary to understand or design antibodies. We present a deep learning method for antibody structure prediction and demonstrate improvement over alternatives on diverse, therapeutically relevant benchmarks. In addition to its improved accuracy, our method reveals interpretable outputs about specific amino acids and residue interactions that should facilitate design of novel therapeutic antibodies.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Therapeutic antibodies make up a rapidly growing segment of the biologics market. However, rational design of antibodies is hindered by reliance on experimental methods for determining antibody structures. In recent years, deep learning methods have driven significant advances in general protein structure prediction. Here, we present DeepAb, a deep learning method for predicting accurate antibody FV structures from sequence. We evaluate DeepAb on two benchmark sets \u2013 one balanced for structural diversity and the other composed of clinical-stage therapeutic antibodies \u2013 and find that our method consistently outperforms the leading alternatives. Previous deep learning methods have operated as \u201cblack boxes\u201d and offered few insights into their predictions. By introducing a directly interpretable attention mechanism, we show that our network attends to physically important residue pairs. For example, in prediction of one CDR H3 residue conformation, the network attends to proximal aromatics and a key hydrogen bonding interaction that constrain the loop conformation. Finally, we present a novel mutant scoring metric derived from network confidence and show that for a particular antibody, all eight of the top-ranked mutations improve binding affinity. These results suggest that this model will be useful for a broad range of antibody prediction and design tasks. Significance Accurate structure models are critical for understanding the properties of potential therapeutic antibodies. Conventional methods for protein structure determination require significant investments of time and resources and may fail. Although greatly improved, methods for general protein structure prediction still cannot consistently provide the accuracy necessary to understand or design antibodies. We present a deep learning method for antibody structure prediction and demonstrate improvement over alternatives on diverse, therapeutically relevant benchmarks. In addition to its improved accuracy, our method reveals interpretable outputs about specific amino acids and residue interactions that should facilitate design of novel therapeutic antibodies."

Due to their binding versatility, antibodies are currently the largest class of biotherapeutics, with five monoclonal antibodies ranked in the top 10 blockbuster drugs. Computational advances in protein modelling and design can have a tangible impact on antibody-based therapeutic development. Antibody-specific computational protocols currently benefit from an increasing volume of data provided by next generation sequencing and application to related drug modalities based on traditional antibodies, such as nanobodies. Here we present a structured overview of available databases, methods and emerging trends in computational antibody analysis and contextualize them towards the engineering of candidate antibody therapeutics.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Antibodies are proteins that recognize the molecular surfaces of potentially noxious molecules to mount an adaptive immune response or, in the case of autoimmune diseases, molecules that are part of healthy cells and tissues. Due to their binding versatility, antibodies are currently the largest class of biotherapeutics, with five monoclonal antibodies ranked in the top 10 blockbuster drugs. Computational advances in protein modelling and design can have a tangible impact on antibody-based therapeutic development. Antibody-specific computational protocols currently benefit from an increasing volume of data provided by next generation sequencing and application to related drug modalities based on traditional antibodies, such as nanobodies. Here we present a structured overview of available databases, methods and emerging trends in computational antibody analysis and contextualize them towards the engineering of candidate antibody therapeutics."

Identification of antibody-antigen interactions is key to antibody engineering. The time-consuming and expensive nature of wet-lab experiments calls for efficient computational methods. Previous deep-learning-based computing methods for antibody-antigen interaction prediction are distinctly divided into two categories: structure-based and sequence-based. Taking into account the non-overlapping advantage of these two major categories, we propose an interpretable antibody-antigen interaction prediction method, S3AI, that bridges structures to sequences through structural information distillation. Furthermore, non-covalent interactions are modeled explicitly to guide neural networks in understanding the underlying patterns in antigen-antibody docking. Supported by the two innovative designs mentioned above, S3AI significantly and comprehensively surpasses the state-of-the-art models. S3AI maintains excellent robustness when predicting unknown antibody-antigen pairs, surpassing specialized prediction methods designed for out-of-distribution generalization in fair comparisons. More importantly, S3AI captures the universal pattern of antibody-antigen interactions, which not only identifies the CDRs responsible for specific binding to the antigen but also unearthed the importance of CDR-H3 for the interaction. The implicit introduction of knowledge of structure modality and the explicit modeling of chemical constraints build a \u2018sequence-to-function\u2019 route, thereby facilitating S3AI\u2019s understanding of complex molecular interactions through providing route and priors guidance. S3AI, which does not require structure input, is suitable for large-scale, parallelized antibody optimization and screening while outperforming state-of-the-art prediction methods. It helps to quickly and accurately identify potential candidates in the vast antibody space, thereby accelerating the development process of antibody drugs.",

Computational design is a promising technology to accelerate antibody discovery and optimisation and to address some critical limitations. However, despite the availability of established in vitro directed evolution technologies that are relatively fast and cheap to deploy, the gold standard for generating therapeutic antibodies remains discovery from animal immunization or patients. Immune-system derived antibodies tend to have favourable properties in vivo, including long half-life, low cross reactivity with self-antigens, and low toxicity, which raises the question of whether computational design will ever be able to generate such antibodies. Here, we present AbNatiV, a deep-learning tool for assessing the nativeness of antibodies and nanobodies, i.e., their likelihood of belonging to the distribution of immune-system derived human antibodies or camelid nanobodies. AbNatiV is trained on curated datasets of human antibodies or camelid nanobodies and can accurately predict the nativeness of a given sequence. We show that AbNatiV can be used to design antibodies and nanobodies that are indistinguishable from immune-system derived ones, to facilitate humanization, and to predict the likelihood of immunogenicity. AbNatiV is a multi-purpose tool that will be valuable for developing antibodies and nanobodies with improved efficacy and safety profiles. We make it readily accessible to users through both downloadable software and as a webserver.",

AbNatiV is trained on curated datasets of human antibodies or camelid nanobodies and can accurately predict the nativeness of a given sequence. We show that AbNatiV can be used to design antibodies and nanobodies that are indistinguishable from immune-system derived ones, to facilitate humanization, and to predict the likelihood of immunogenicity. AbNatiV is a multi-purpose tool that will be valuable for developing antibodies and nanobodies with improved efficacy and safety profiles. We make it readily accessible to users through both downloadable software and as a webserver."

Additionally, the field lacks standardized criteria for selecting complexes based on structural properties and sequence identity. Common practices in data set construction rely on removing redundancy using sequence identity thresholds, which can inadvertently exclude complexes with alternative binding modes that share identical sequences. To enable more precise Ab-Ag modeling and antibody engineering, it is essential to incorporate richer structural and physical information into both physics-based and machine learning models. To address these limitations, we present ANABAG, a new curated data set of Ab-Ag complexes annotated at the residue level with UniProt sequence information and enriched with a wide range of structural and physicochemical features. The data set allows flexible filtering of complexes using a variety of descriptors available at both the complex and residue levels. Selected features are ready to use in machine learning workflows, while the structural files are compatible with antibody design and docking pipelines like Rosetta or Haddock.

Cutting-edge computational methods have revolutionized our understanding of protein\u2013protein interactions (PPIs), enhancing the efficacy of protein therapeutics in preclinical and clinical settings. Central to these advancements is the application of machine learning and deep learning, which offers unprecedented insights into the intricate mechanisms of PPIs and facilitates precise control over protein functions. Despite these advancements, the complex structural nuances of antibodies pose ongoing challenges in their design and optimization. Our review provides a comprehensive exploration of the latest deep learning approaches, including language models and diffusion techniques, and their role in surmounting these challenges. We also present a critical analysis of these methods, offering insights to drive further progress in this rapidly evolving field. The paper includes practical recommendations for the application of these computational techniques, supplemented with independent benchmark studies. These studies focus on key performance metrics such as accuracy and the ease of program execution, providing a valuable resource for researchers engaged in antibody design and development. Through this detailed perspective, we aim to contribute to the advancement of antibody design, equipping researchers with the tools and knowledge to navigate the complexities of this field.",

Computational approaches to developing and designing these molecules are being increasingly used to complement traditional lab-based processes. Nowadays, in silico methods fill multiple elements of the discovery stage, such as characterizing antibody\u2013antigen interactions and identifying developability liabilities. Recently, computational methods tackling such problems have begun to follow machine learning paradigms, in many cases deep learning specifically. This paradigm shift offers improvements in established areas such as structure or binding prediction and opens up new possibilities such as language-based modeling of antibody repertoires or machine-learning-based generation of novel sequences. In this review, we critically examine the recent developments in (deep) machine learning approaches to therapeutic antibody design with implications for fully computational antibody design.",

Computational approaches to developing and designing these molecules are being increasingly used to complement traditional lab-based processes. Nowadays, in silico methods fill multiple elements of the discovery stage, such as characterizing antibody\u2013antigen interactions and identifying developability liabilities. Recently, computational methods tackling such problems have begun to follow machine learning paradigms, in many cases deep learning specifically. This paradigm shift offers improvements in established areas such as structure or binding prediction and opens up new possibilities such as language-based modeling of antibody repertoires or machine-learning-based generation of novel sequences. In this review, we critically examine the recent developments in (deep) machine learning approaches to therapeutic antibody design with implications for fully computational antibody design."

                "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing cancer immunotherapy by addressing the complex interplay between cancer and the immune system. This chapter explores how AI technologies enhance immunotherapy development across multiple domains: antibody design, response prediction, biomarker identification, and T-cell target discovery. In therapeutic antibody design, AI improves efficiency through predictive modeling of antibody-antigen interactions, structure prediction tools, generative models that create novel antibody sequences, and developability optimization. Clinical applications include AI-powered systems that predict immunotherapy responses using multi-omics data integration, helping distinguish pseudoprogression from true disease progression. Beyond conventional biomarkers like programmed cell death protein 1, AI enables identification of additional markers including tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, immune cell infiltration patterns, and novel genomic alterations. Multi-omics approaches leverage AI to synthesize diverse data types, uncovering complex biomarker signatures that more accurately predict treatment outcomes. For T-cell target identification, next-generation immunoediting platforms like Gritstone's EDGE\u2122 system exemplify AI-powered approaches that precisely identify neoantigens by integrating sequencing technologies with sophisticated prediction algorithms (Table 2.1). These platforms support both personalized and shared antigen approaches to immunotherapy, potentially enhanced through integration with innate immune pathways. Despite remarkable progress, challenges persist in addressing tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion mechanisms, and technical limitations in prediction algorithms. The continued refinement of AI approaches, expansion to diverse cancer types, and integration with complementary therapeutic modalities represent promising future directions. Overall, AI and ML are poised to transform cancer immunotherapy by enabling more precise, effective, and personalized treatment approaches that harness the immune system's power against cancer.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are revolutionizing cancer immunotherapy by addressing the complex interplay between cancer and the immune system. This chapter explores how AI technologies enhance immunotherapy development across multiple domains: antibody design, response prediction, biomarker identification, and T-cell target discovery. In therapeutic antibody design, AI improves efficiency through predictive modeling of antibody-antigen interactions, structure prediction tools, generative models that create novel antibody sequences, and developability optimization. Clinical applications include AI-powered systems that predict immunotherapy responses using multi-omics data integration, helping distinguish pseudoprogression from true disease progression. Beyond conventional biomarkers like programmed cell death protein 1, AI enables identification of additional markers including tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, immune cell infiltration patterns, and novel genomic alterations. Multi-omics approaches leverage AI to synthesize diverse data types, uncovering complex biomarker signatures that more accurately predict treatment outcomes. For T-cell target identification, next-generation immunoediting platforms like Gritstone's EDGE\u2122 system exemplify AI-powered approaches that precisely identify neoantigens by integrating sequencing technologies with sophisticated prediction algorithms (Table 2.1). These platforms support both personalized and shared antigen approaches to immunotherapy, potentially enhanced through integration with innate immune pathways. Despite remarkable progress, challenges persist in addressing tumor heterogeneity, immune evasion mechanisms, and technical limitations in prediction algorithms. The continued refinement of AI approaches, expansion to diverse cancer types, and integration with complementary therapeutic modalities represent promising future directions. Overall, AI and ML are poised to transform cancer immunotherapy by enabling more precise, effective, and personalized treatment approaches that harness the immune system's power against cancer."

The virus is endemic in more than 128 countries resulting in approximately 390 million infection cases each year. Currently, there is no approved therapeutic for treatment nor a fully efficacious vaccine. The development of therapeutics is confounded and hampered by the complexity of the immune response to DENV, in particular to sequential infection with different DENV serotypes (DENV1-5). Researchers have shown that the DENV envelope (E) antigen is primarily responsible for the interaction and subsequent invasion of host cells for all serotypes and can elicit neutralizing antibodies in humans. The advent of high-throughput sequencing and the rapid advancements in computational analysis of complex data, has provided tools for the deconvolution of the DENV immune response. Several types of complex statistical analyses, machine learning models and complex visualizations can be applied to begin answering questions about the B- and T-cell immune responses to multiple infections, antibody-dependent enhancement, identification of novel therapeutics and advance vaccine research.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Dengue virus (DENV) poses a serious threat to global health as the causative agent of dengue fever. The virus is endemic in more than 128 countries resulting in approximately 390 million infection cases each year. Currently, there is no approved therapeutic for treatment nor a fully efficacious vaccine. The development of therapeutics is confounded and hampered by the complexity of the immune response to DENV, in particular to sequential infection with different DENV serotypes (DENV1-5). Researchers have shown that the DENV envelope (E) antigen is primarily responsible for the interaction and subsequent invasion of host cells for all serotypes and can elicit neutralizing antibodies in humans. The advent of high-throughput sequencing and the rapid advancements in computational analysis of complex data, has provided tools for the deconvolution of the DENV immune response. Several types of complex statistical analyses, machine learning models and complex visualizations can be applied to begin answering questions about the B- and T-cell immune responses to multiple infections, antibody-dependent enhancement, identification of novel therapeutics and advance vaccine research."

After the introduction of hybridoma technology in 1975, the mAb market has increased dramatically, moving a large industry of more than US$ 140 billions in 2020. In 1954, the concept of the 3R\u2019s was proposed and much changed the animal use scenario, including the recent ban on inducing ascites in mice for the production of mAb. In light of this, the generation and production of antibodies had to be reassessed. In this chapter, we present an overview of the main alternative technologies to the use of animals in the generation and production of mAb. Antibody display libraries and in silico modeling are very promising technologies that may provide mAb genetic constructs that, in the sequence, may be expressed on mammalian, bacterial, yeast or plant systems. Although the total replacement of the use of animals in the entire process is not currently feasible, it is possible to find ways to reduce and refine the use of animals in obtaining and producing mAb.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Monoclonal antibody (mAb) has broad applicability in research, diagnosis, and treatment. After the introduction of hybridoma technology in 1975, the mAb market has increased dramatically, moving a large industry of more than US$ 140 billions in 2020. In 1954, the concept of the 3R\u2019s was proposed and much changed the animal use scenario, including the recent ban on inducing ascites in mice for the production of mAb. In light of this, the generation and production of antibodies had to be reassessed. In this chapter, we present an overview of the main alternative technologies to the use of animals in the generation and production of mAb. Antibody display libraries and in silico modeling are very promising technologies that may provide mAb genetic constructs that, in the sequence, may be expressed on mammalian, bacterial, yeast or plant systems. Although the total replacement of the use of animals in the entire process is not currently feasible, it is possible to find ways to reduce and refine the use of animals in obtaining and producing mAb."

However, the process of obtaining therapeutic antibodies remains time consuming and empirical. This review summarizes recent progresses in the field of computer-aided antibody development mainly focusing on antibody modeling, which is divided essentially into two parts: (i) modeling the antigen-binding site, also called the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), and (ii) predicting the relative orientations of the variable heavy (V(H)) and light (V(L)) chains. Among the six CDR loops, the greatest challenge is predicting the conformation of CDR-H3, which is the most important in antigen recognition. Further computational methods could be used in drug development based on crystal structures or homology models, including antibody-antigen dockings and energy calculations with approximate potential functions. These methods should guide experimental studies to improve the affinities and physicochemical properties of antibodies. Finally, several successful examples of in silico structure-based antibody designs are reviewed. We also briefly review structure-based antigen or immunogen design, with application to rational vaccine development.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Recent clinical trials using antibodies with low toxicity and high efficiency have raised expectations for the development of next-generation protein therapeutics. However, the process of obtaining therapeutic antibodies remains time consuming and empirical. This review summarizes recent progresses in the field of computer-aided antibody development mainly focusing on antibody modeling, which is divided essentially into two parts: (i) modeling the antigen-binding site, also called the complementarity determining regions (CDRs), and (ii) predicting the relative orientations of the variable heavy (V(H)) and light (V(L)) chains. Among the six CDR loops, the greatest challenge is predicting the conformation of CDR-H3, which is the most important in antigen recognition. Further computational methods could be used in drug development based on crystal structures or homology models, including antibody-antigen dockings and energy calculations with approximate potential functions. These methods should guide experimental studies to improve the affinities and physicochemical properties of antibodies. Finally, several successful examples of in silico structure-based antibody designs are reviewed. We also briefly review structure-based antigen or immunogen design, with application to rational vaccine development."

To deliver a potentially immediate and lasting treatment to current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, new collaborations and ways of sharing are required to create as many paths forward as possible. Here we leverage our expertise in computational antibody engineering to rationally design/optimize three previously reported SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and share our proposal towards anti-SARS-CoV-2 biologics therapeutics. SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, m396, 80R, and CR-3022 were chosen as templates due to their diversified epitopes and confirmed neutralization potency against SARS. Structures of variable fragment (Fv) in complex with receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV2 were subjected to our established in silico antibody engineering platform to improve their binding affinity to SARS-CoV2 and developability profiles. The selected top mutations were ensembled into a focused library for each antibody for further screening. In addition, we convert the selected binders with different epitopes into the trispecific format, aiming to increase potency and to prevent mutational escape. Lastly, to avoid antibody induced virus activation or enhancement, we applied NNAS and DQ mutations to the Fc region to eliminate effector functions and extend half-life.",

To deliver a potentially immediate and lasting treatment to current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, new collaborations and ways of sharing are required to create as many paths forward as possible. Here we leverage our expertise in computational antibody engineering to rationally design/optimize three previously reported SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies and share our proposal towards anti-SARS-CoV-2 biologics therapeutics. SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, m396, 80R, and CR-3022 were chosen as templates due to their diversified epitopes and confirmed neutralization potency against SARS. Structures of variable fragment (Fv) in complex with receptor binding domain (RBD) from SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV2 were subjected to our established in silico antibody engineering platform to improve their binding affinity to SARS-CoV2 and developability profiles. The selected top mutations were ensembled into a focused library for each antibody for further screening. In addition, we convert the selected binders with different epitopes into the trispecific format, aiming to increase potency and to prevent mutational escape. Lastly, to avoid antibody induced virus activation or enhancement, we applied NNAS and DQ mutations to the Fc region to eliminate effector functions and extend half-life."

With the advent of next-generation sequencing, billions of antibody sequences have been collected in recent years, though their application in the design of better therapeutics has been constrained by the sheer volume and complexity of the data. To address this challenge, we present IgBert and IgT5, the best performing antibody-specific language models developed to date which can consistently handle both paired and unpaired variable region sequences as input. These models are trained comprehensively using the more than two billion unpaired sequences and two million paired sequences of light and heavy chains present in the Observed Antibody Space dataset. We show that our models outperform existing antibody and protein language models on a diverse range of design and regression tasks relevant to antibody engineering. This advancement marks a significant leap forward in leveraging machine learning, large scale data sets and high-performance computing for enhancing antibody design for therapeutic development.",

With the advent of next-generation sequencing, billions of antibody sequences have been collected in recent years, though their application in the design of better therapeutics has been constrained by the sheer volume and complexity of the data. To address this challenge, we present IgBert and IgT5, the best performing antibody-specific language models developed to date which can consistently handle both paired and unpaired variable region sequences as input. These models are trained comprehensively using the more than two billion unpaired sequences and two million paired sequences of light and heavy chains present in the Observed Antibody Space dataset. We show that our models outperform existing antibody and protein language models on a diverse range of design and regression tasks relevant to antibody engineering. This advancement marks a significant leap forward in leveraging machine learning, large scale data sets and high-performance computing for enhancing antibody design for therapeutic development."

Building on the wealth of available sequence data, we implemented a computational shuffling approach to antibody components, using the complementarity-determining region (CDR) and the framework region (FWR) to optimize an antibody for improved affinity and developability. This approach uses a set of rules to suitably combine the CDRs and FWRs derived from naturally occurring antibody sequences to engineer an antibody with high affinity and specificity. To illustrate this approach, we selected a representative SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody, H4, which was identified and isolated previously based on the predominant germlines that were employed in a human host to target the SARS-CoV-2-human ACE2 receptor interaction. Compared to screening vast CDR libraries for affinity enhancements, our approach identified fewer than 100 antibody framework\u2013CDR combinations, from which we screened and selected an antibody (CB79) that showed a reduced dissociation rate and improved affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (7-fold) when compared to H4. The improved affinity also translated into improved neutralization (>75-fold improvement) of SARS-CoV-2. Our rapid and robust approach for optimizing antibodies from parts without the need for tedious structure-guided CDR optimization will have broad utility for biotechnological applications.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "The computational methods used for engineering antibodies for clinical development have undergone a transformation from three-dimensional structure-guided approaches to artificial-intelligence- and machine-learning-based approaches that leverage the large sequence data space of hundreds of millions of antibodies generated by next-generation sequencing (NGS) studies. Building on the wealth of available sequence data, we implemented a computational shuffling approach to antibody components, using the complementarity-determining region (CDR) and the framework region (FWR) to optimize an antibody for improved affinity and developability. This approach uses a set of rules to suitably combine the CDRs and FWRs derived from naturally occurring antibody sequences to engineer an antibody with high affinity and specificity. To illustrate this approach, we selected a representative SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody, H4, which was identified and isolated previously based on the predominant germlines that were employed in a human host to target the SARS-CoV-2-human ACE2 receptor interaction. Compared to screening vast CDR libraries for affinity enhancements, our approach identified fewer than 100 antibody framework\u2013CDR combinations, from which we screened and selected an antibody (CB79) that showed a reduced dissociation rate and improved affinity against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (7-fold) when compared to H4. The improved affinity also translated into improved neutralization (>75-fold improvement) of SARS-CoV-2. Our rapid and robust approach for optimizing antibodies from parts without the need for tedious structure-guided CDR optimization will have broad utility for biotechnological applications."

Koch and Tesar [5] review the concept of bispecific antibodies as effector cell engagers and discuss promisThe implementation of therapeutic antibodies has revolutionized the therapy of cancer patients. Based on the clinical success of prototypic tumor-targeting antibodies like rituximab and trastuzumab, the way for a variety of next-generation antibodies with improved characteristics was opened. Innovations in techniques to generate humanized or even human molecules (e.g. phage display, mice engineered to express human antibody repertoires) were key for the clinical triumph of first-generation antibodies. Despite the proven clinical activity in different cancer entities, not all patients respond to antibody therapy. Consequently, novel approaches to improve this generally well tolerated therapy are major areas of research in academia and in pharmaceutical industry. A deeper understanding of pathophysiological coherences, identification of critical checkpoints in the interaction of tumor cells and the immune system as well as novel insights into the mechanisms of action mediated by therapeutic antibodies have fueled innovations in antibody engineering. Obvious engineering strategies include approaches in improving IgG intrinsic effector mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibodydependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Besides engineering conventional IgG antibodies, innovative antibody derivatives such as bispecific antibodies, antibody drug conjugates, and antibody fusion proteins have been developed and corresponding prototypic agents were recently approved or are in various phases of clinical development. Several aspects of established and emerging antibody engineering technologies are addressed in this issue of Transfusion Medicine and Hemotherapy (fig. 1). Frenzel and colleagues [1] summarize opportunities and achievements of phage display, including the generation of antibodies with specificities which could not be generated otherwise.

It allows us to collect, connect, and analyze biological data at a large scale and build predictive models. In the twenty first century, computational resources along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been widely used in various fields of biological sciences such as biochemistry, structural biology, immunology, microbiology, and genomics to handle massive data for decision-making, including in applications such as drug design and vaccine development, one of the major areas of focus for human and animal welfare. The knowledge of available computational resources and AI-enabled tools in vaccine design and development can improve our ability to conduct cutting-edge research. Therefore, this review article aims to summarize important computational resources and AI-based tools.

It allows us to collect, connect, and analyze biological data at a large scale and build predictive models. In the twenty first century, computational resources along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) have been widely used in various fields of biological sciences such as biochemistry, structural biology, immunology, microbiology, and genomics to handle massive data for decision-making, including in applications such as drug design and vaccine development, one of the major areas of focus for human and animal welfare. The knowledge of available computational resources and AI-enabled tools in vaccine design and development can improve our ability to conduct cutting-edge research. Therefore, this review article aims to summarize important computational resources and AI-based tools. Further, the article discusses the various applications and limitations of AI tools in vaccine development. "

Artificial intelligence is a computational technique which is inspired by natural intelligence such as the swarming of birds, the working of the brain and the pathfinding of the ants. These techniques have impact on economic theories. This book studies the impact of artificial intelligence on economic theories, a subject that has not been extensively studied. The theories that are considered are: demand and supply, asymmetrical information, pricing, rational choice, rational expectation, game theory, efficient market hypotheses, mechanism design, prospect, bounded rationality, portfolio theory, rational counterfactual and causality. The benefit of this book is that it evaluates existing theories of economics and update them based on the developments in artificial intelligence field.",

The theories that are considered are: demand and supply, asymmetrical information, pricing, rational choice, rational expectation, game theory, efficient market hypotheses, mechanism design, prospect, bounded rationality, portfolio theory, rational counterfactual and causality. The benefit of this book is that it evaluates existing theories of economics and update them based on the developments in artificial intelligence field."

                "abstract": "In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence (AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential functions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare policies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial intelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data) by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a 30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain environments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of research and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized medicine.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "In the modern healthcare system, rapidly expanding costs/complexity, the growing myriad of treatment options, and exploding information streams that often do not effectively reach the front lines hinder the ability to choose optimal treatment decisions over time. The goal in this paper is to develop a general purpose (non-disease-specific) computational/artificial intelligence (AI) framework to address these challenges. This serves two potential functions: 1) a simulation environment for exploring various healthcare policies, payment methodologies, etc., and 2) the basis for clinical artificial intelligence - an AI that can think like a doctor. This approach combines Markov decision processes and dynamic decision networks to learn from clinical data and develop complex plans via simulation of alternative sequential decision paths while capturing the sometimes conflicting, sometimes synergistic interactions of various components in the healthcare system. It can operate in partially observable environments (in the case of missing observations or data) by maintaining belief states about patient health status and functions as an online agent that plans and re-plans. This framework was evaluated using real patient data from an electronic health record. Such an AI framework easily outperforms the current treatment-as-usual (TAU) case-rate/fee-for-service models of healthcare (Cost per Unit Change: $189 vs. $497) while obtaining a 30-35% increase in patient outcomes. Tweaking certain model parameters further enhances this advantage, obtaining roughly 50% more improvement for roughly half the costs. Given careful design and problem formulation, an AI simulation framework can approximate optimal decisions even in complex and uncertain environments. Future work is described that outlines potential lines of research and integration of machine learning algorithms for personalized medicine."

However, most of these techniques do not provide human-understandable explanations for supporting their results and decisions. They usually act as black boxes, and it is not easy to understand how decisions have been made. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which has received much interest recently, tries to provide human-understandable explanations for decision-making and trained AI models. For instance, in digital agriculture, related domains often present peculiar or input features with no link to background knowledge. The application of the data mining process on agricultural data leads to results (knowledge), which are difficult to explain. In this paper, we propose a knowledge map model and an ontology design as an XAI framework (OAK4XAI) to deal with this issue. The framework does not only consider the data analysis part of the process, but it takes into account the semantics aspect of the domain knowledge via an ontology and a knowledge map model, provided as modules of the framework. Many ongoing XAI studies aim to provide accurate and verbalizable accounts for how given feature values contribute to model decisions. The proposed approach, however, focuses on providing consistent information and definitions of concepts, algorithms, and values involved in the data mining models.

Among its most promising applications, AI research is blossoming in concrete science and engineering, where it has offered new insights towards mixture design optimization and service life prediction of cementitious systems. This chapter aims to uncover the main research interests and knowledge structure of the existing literature on AI for concrete materials. To begin with, a total of 389 journal articles published from 1990 to 2020 were retrieved from the Web of Science. Scientometric tools such as keyword co-occurrence analysis and documentation co-citation analysis were adopted to quantify features and characteristics of the research field. The findings bring to light pressing questions in data-driven concrete research and suggest future opportunities for the concrete community to fully utilize the capabilities of AI techniques."

Key inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-17, IL-23, and type I/II interferons, promote disease progression by activating autoreactive lymphocytes, recruiting immune cells, and causing ongoing tissue damage. The development of therapeutic antibodies targeting these cytokines has transformed treatment approaches, providing targeted immunomodulation while reducing systemic immunosuppression. Clinically approved biologics, including TNF inhibitors (Adalimumab, Infliximab), IL-6R blockers (Tocilizumab), and IL-17/IL-23 pathway antagonists (Secukinumab, Ustekinumab), show strong efficacy in various autoimmune conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and psoriasis. Emerging strategies, such as bispecific antibodies and AI-optimized designs, further enhance therapeutic precision by targeting multiple inflammatory pathways or refining antibody functions simultaneously. This review highlights the pivotal role of inflammatory cytokines in autoimmune pathogenesis and assesses the clinical impact of cytokine-targeted biologics, emphasizing their potential for achieving disease modification and long-term remission. Future advancements in personalized immunomodulation are expected to improve therapeutic outcomes for refractory autoimmune diseases. ",

Antibody discovery and development have been driven by diverse methodologies. Classical strategies such as mouse hybridoma technology, phage display, transgenic mouse models, and single B cell isolation have enabled the generation of high-affinity therapeutic antibodies. Beyond binding affinity, recent innovations in combinatorial antibody libraries have facilitated the selection of functional antibodies within cellular environments, revealing their ability to act as agonists or antagonists and influence signal transduction pathways. These insights expand therapeutic applications by enabling modulation of complex cellular responses. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, involving antibody generation supported by rapidly growing antibody sequence and structure databases, are transforming computational protein design. This review highlights five major approaches (hybridoma technology, phage display, transgenic mouse models, and single B cell isolation, de novo antibody design) for antibody discovery and development. These approaches offer innovative strategies designed to accelerate the discovery process and enhance therapeutic outcomes for human diseases.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) represent one of the most successful classes of biopharmaceuticals, with more than 100 approved for treating oncological, immunological, and infectious diseases. Antibody discovery and development have been driven by diverse methodologies. Classical strategies such as mouse hybridoma technology, phage display, transgenic mouse models, and single B cell isolation have enabled the generation of high-affinity therapeutic antibodies. Beyond binding affinity, recent innovations in combinatorial antibody libraries have facilitated the selection of functional antibodies within cellular environments, revealing their ability to act as agonists or antagonists and influence signal transduction pathways. These insights expand therapeutic applications by enabling modulation of complex cellular responses. Recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, involving antibody generation supported by rapidly growing antibody sequence and structure databases, are transforming computational protein design. This review highlights five major approaches (hybridoma technology, phage display, transgenic mouse models, and single B cell isolation, de novo antibody design) for antibody discovery and development. These approaches offer innovative strategies designed to accelerate the discovery process and enhance therapeutic outcomes for human diseases."

                "abstract": "In the task abstraction phase of the visualization design process, including in \"design studies\", a practitioner maps the observed domain goals to generalizable abstract tasks using visualization theory in order to better understand and address the users needs. We argue that this manual task abstraction process is prone to errors due to designer biases and a lack of domain background and knowledge. Under these circumstances, a collaborator can help validate and provide sanity checks to visualization practitioners during this important task abstraction stage. However, having a human collaborator is not always feasible and may be subject to the same biases and pitfalls. In this paper, we first describe the challenges associated with task abstraction. We then propose a conceptual Digital Collaborator: an artificial intelligence system that aims to help visualization practitioners by augmenting their ability to validate and reason about the output of task abstraction. We also discuss several practical design challenges of designing and implementing such systems",

We argue that this manual task abstraction process is prone to errors due to designer biases and a lack of domain background and knowledge. Under these circumstances, a collaborator can help validate and provide sanity checks to visualization practitioners during this important task abstraction stage. However, having a human collaborator is not always feasible and may be subject to the same biases and pitfalls. In this paper, we first describe the challenges associated with task abstraction. We then propose a conceptual Digital Collaborator: an artificial intelligence system that aims to help visualization practitioners by augmenting their ability to validate and reason about the output of task abstraction. We also discuss several practical design challenges of designing and implementing such systems"

This review aims to discuss different principles of AI-driven generative models that are applicable for materials discovery, including different materials representations available for this purpose. We will also highlight specific applications of generative models in designing new catalysts, semiconductors, polymers, or crystals while addressing challenges such as data scarcity, computational cost, interpretability, synthesizability, and dataset biases.

Learning and optimisation, decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments, game theory, planning and scheduling, design and education are common research areas shared between games and real-world problems. Numerous open-source games or game-based environments have been implemented for studying artificial intelligence. In addition to single- or multi-player, collaborative or adversarial games, there has also been growing interest in implementing platforms for creative design in recent years. Those platforms provide ideal benchmarks for exploring and comparing artificial intelligence ideas and techniques. This paper reviews the games and game-based platforms for artificial intelligence research, provides guidance on matching particular types of artificial intelligence with suitable games for testing and matching particular needs in games with suitable artificial intelligence techniques, discusses the research trend induced by the evolution of those games and platforms, and gives an outlook.",

Learning and optimisation, decision making in dynamic and uncertain environments, game theory, planning and scheduling, design and education are common research areas shared between games and real-world problems. Numerous open-source games or game-based environments have been implemented for studying artificial intelligence. In addition to single- or multi-player, collaborative or adversarial games, there has also been growing interest in implementing platforms for creative design in recent years. Those platforms provide ideal benchmarks for exploring and comparing artificial intelligence ideas and techniques. This paper reviews the games and game-based platforms for artificial intelligence research, provides guidance on matching particular types of artificial intelligence with suitable games for testing and matching particular needs in games with suitable artificial intelligence techniques, discusses the research trend induced by the evolution of those games and platforms, and gives an outlook."

                "abstract": "Since genetic engineering of humanized murine monoclonal antibodies was first demonstrated over two decades ago, antibody engineering technologies have evolved based upon an increasing understanding of the mechanisms involved in antibody generation in vivo, and a constant search for alternative routes to evolve and exploit the characteristics of antibodies. As a result, antibody engineers have devised innovative strategies for the rapid evolution and selection of antibodies and novel antibody designs (i.e., antibody fragments). Phage display, cell display and ribosome display technologies, which comprise the core of the currently available technologies for the discovery and preparation of such antibodies, are reviewed herein. This article intends to communicate the state-of-the-art technology available for the engineering of antibodies to a general readership interested in this important field. Therefore, important immunology concepts are introduced before detailed descriptions of the three antibody engineering technologies are presented in later sections. A comparison of these methodologies suggests that despite the predominance of phage display for the engineering of antibody fragments in the past 20 years, cell display and ribosome display will likely gain importance in the selection and discovery of the antibody fragments in the future. Finally, these technologies are likely to play an important role in the production of the next generation of antibody-based therapeutics.\r\n\r\nResumen\u2014Las tecnologias para la ingenieria de anticuerpos han evolucionado durante las ultimas dos decadas, desde la demostracion de la posibilidad de humanizar anticuerpos monoclonales de raton mediante ingenieria genetica, apoyadas en el creciente entendimiento de los mecanismos involucrados en la generacion de anticuerpos in vivo, y en una busqueda constante de rutas alternativas para evolucionar y explotar sus caracteristicas. Es asi como los ingenieros de anticuerpos han desarrollado estrategias innovadoras para la evolucion y seleccion de anticuerpos y de novedosos disenos de anticuerpos conocidos como fragmentos de anticuerpos. Esta revision se enfoca en tres tecnologias que comprenden el nucleo de las tecnologias actualmente disponibles para el descubrimiento y preparacion de tales anticuerpos: la presentacion en fagos, la presentacion en celulas, y la presentacion en ribosomas. Este articulo busca presentar el estado del arte de estas tecnologias a un grupo general de lectores interesados en este campo, por lo que inicialmente se introducen importantes conceptos de inmunologia requeridos para comprender en detalle las tecnologias discutidas. Una comparacion de estas metodologias para la ingenieria de anticuerpos sugiere que a pesar del dominio de las tecnologias basadas en la presentacion en fagos durante los ultimos 20 anos, en los proximos anos la presentacion en celulas y la presentacion en ribosomas probablemente ganaran importancia para la seleccion y descubrimiento de fragmentos de anticuerpos. Finalmente, es probable que estas tecnologias jueguen un papel importante en la produccion de la siguiente generacion de terapeuticos basados en anticuerpos.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Since genetic engineering of humanized murine monoclonal antibodies was first demonstrated over two decades ago, antibody engineering technologies have evolved based upon an increasing understanding of the mechanisms involved in antibody generation in vivo, and a constant search for alternative routes to evolve and exploit the characteristics of antibodies. As a result, antibody engineers have devised innovative strategies for the rapid evolution and selection of antibodies and novel antibody designs (i.e., antibody fragments). Phage display, cell display and ribosome display technologies, which comprise the core of the currently available technologies for the discovery and preparation of such antibodies, are reviewed herein. This article intends to communicate the state-of-the-art technology available for the engineering of antibodies to a general readership interested in this important field. Therefore, important immunology concepts are introduced before detailed descriptions of the three antibody engineering technologies are presented in later sections. A comparison of these methodologies suggests that despite the predominance of phage display for the engineering of antibody fragments in the past 20 years, cell display and ribosome display will likely gain importance in the selection and discovery of the antibody fragments in the future. Finally, these technologies are likely to play an important role in the production of the next generation of antibody-based therapeutics.\r\n\r\nResumen\u2014Las tecnologias para la ingenieria de anticuerpos han evolucionado durante las ultimas dos decadas, desde la demostracion de la posibilidad de humanizar anticuerpos monoclonales de raton mediante ingenieria genetica, apoyadas en el creciente entendimiento de los mecanismos involucrados en la generacion de anticuerpos in vivo, y en una busqueda constante de rutas alternativas para evolucionar y explotar sus caracteristicas. Es asi como los ingenieros de anticuerpos han desarrollado estrategias innovadoras para la evolucion y seleccion de anticuerpos y de novedosos disenos de anticuerpos conocidos como fragmentos de anticuerpos. Esta revision se enfoca en tres tecnologias que comprenden el nucleo de las tecnologias actualmente disponibles para el descubrimiento y preparacion de tales anticuerpos: la presentacion en fagos, la presentacion en celulas, y la presentacion en ribosomas. Este articulo busca presentar el estado del arte de estas tecnologias a un grupo general de lectores interesados en este campo, por lo que inicialmente se introducen importantes conceptos de inmunologia requeridos para comprender en detalle las tecnologias discutidas. Una comparacion de estas metodologias para la ingenieria de anticuerpos sugiere que a pesar del dominio de las tecnologias basadas en la presentacion en fagos durante los ultimos 20 anos, en los proximos anos la presentacion en celulas y la presentacion en ribosomas probablemente ganaran importancia para la seleccion y descubrimiento de fragmentos de anticuerpos. Finalmente, es probable que estas tecnologias jueguen un papel importante en la produccion de la siguiente generacion de terapeuticos basados en anticuerpos."

This review considers the structure of different types of recombinant antibodies, their mechanism of action and how their efficacy has been increased using a broad array of approaches. We will also focus on the additional benefits offered by the use of gene therapy methods for the in vivo production of therapeutic antibodies."

                "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a stimulating discussion on how artificial intelligence (AI) can support the science and engineering of intelligent educational applications. Many studies in the field are proposing actionable data mining pipelines and machine-learning models driven by learning-related data. The potential of these pipelines and models to amplify unfairness for certain categories of students is however receiving increasing attention. If AI applications are to have a positive impact on education, it is crucial that their design considers fairness at every step. Through anonymous surveys and interviews with experts (researchers and practitioners) who have published their research at top-tier educational conferences in the last year, we conducted the first expert-driven systematic investigation on the challenges and needs for addressing fairness throughout the development of educational systems based on AI. We identified common and diverging views about the challenges and the needs faced by educational technologies experts in practice, that lead the community to have a clear understanding on the main questions raising doubts in this topic. Based on these findings, we highlighted directions that will facilitate the ongoing research towards fairer AI for education.",

In this regard, progress in the generation of data describing antigen binding and developability, computational methodology, and artificial intelligence may pave the way for a new era of in silico on-demand immunotherapeutics design and discovery. Here, we argue that the main necessary machine learning (ML) components for an in silico mAb sequence generator are: understanding of the rules of mAb-antigen binding, capacity to modularly combine mAb design parameters, and algorithms for unconstrained parameter-driven in silico mAb sequence synthesis. We review the current progress toward the realization of these necessary components and discuss the challenges that must be overcome to allow the on-demand ML-based discovery and design of fit-for-purpose mAb therapeutic candidates.",

In this regard, progress in the generation of data describing antigen binding and developability, computational methodology, and artificial intelligence may pave the way for a new era of in silico on-demand immunotherapeutics design and discovery. Here, we argue that the main necessary machine learning (ML) components for an in silico mAb sequence generator are: understanding of the rules of mAb-antigen binding, capacity to modularly combine mAb design parameters, and algorithms for unconstrained parameter-driven in silico mAb sequence synthesis. We review the current progress toward the realization of these necessary components and discuss the challenges that must be overcome to allow the on-demand ML-based discovery and design of fit-for-purpose mAb therapeutic candidates."

                "abstract": "Collectiveness is an important property of many systems--both natural and artificial. By exploiting a large number of individuals, it is often possible to produce effects that go far beyond the capabilities of the smartest individuals, or even to produce intelligent collective behaviour out of not-so-intelligent individuals. Indeed, collective intelligence, namely the capability of a group to act collectively in a seemingly intelligent way, is increasingly often a design goal of engineered computational systems--motivated by recent techno-scientific trends like the Internet of Things, swarm robotics, and crowd computing, just to name a few. For several years, the collective intelligence observed in natural and artificial systems has served as a source of inspiration for engineering ideas, models, and mechanisms. Today, artificial and computational collective intelligence are recognised research topics, spanning various techniques, kinds of target systems, and application domains. However, there is still a lot of fragmentation in the research panorama of the topic within computer science, and the verticality of most communities and contributions makes it difficult to extract the core underlying ideas and frames of reference. The challenge is to identify, place in a common structure, and ultimately connect the different areas and methods addressing intelligent collectives. To address this gap, this paper considers a set of broad scoping questions providing a map of collective intelligence research, mostly by the point of view of computer scientists and engineers. Accordingly, it covers preliminary notions, fundamental concepts, and the main research perspectives, identifying opportunities and challenges for researchers on artificial and computational collective intelligence engineering.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "Collectiveness is an important property of many systems--both natural and artificial. By exploiting a large number of individuals, it is often possible to produce effects that go far beyond the capabilities of the smartest individuals, or even to produce intelligent collective behaviour out of not-so-intelligent individuals. Indeed, collective intelligence, namely the capability of a group to act collectively in a seemingly intelligent way, is increasingly often a design goal of engineered computational systems--motivated by recent techno-scientific trends like the Internet of Things, swarm robotics, and crowd computing, just to name a few. For several years, the collective intelligence observed in natural and artificial systems has served as a source of inspiration for engineering ideas, models, and mechanisms. Today, artificial and computational collective intelligence are recognised research topics, spanning various techniques, kinds of target systems, and application domains. However, there is still a lot of fragmentation in the research panorama of the topic within computer science, and the verticality of most communities and contributions makes it difficult to extract the core underlying ideas and frames of reference. The challenge is to identify, place in a common structure, and ultimately connect the different areas and methods addressing intelligent collectives. To address this gap, this paper considers a set of broad scoping questions providing a map of collective intelligence research, mostly by the point of view of computer scientists and engineers. Accordingly, it covers preliminary notions, fundamental concepts, and the main research perspectives, identifying opportunities and challenges for researchers on artificial and computational collective intelligence engineering."

In this paper, we propose a design for user-centered compliant-by-design transparency in transparent systems.

A well-functioning transit system fosters the growth and expansion of businesses, distributes social and economic benefits, and links the capabilities of community members, thereby enhancing what they can accomplish as a society. Since affordable public transit services are the backbones of many communities, this work investigates ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve efficiency and increase utilization from the perspective of transit agencies. This book chapter discusses the primary requirements, objectives, and challenges related to the design of AI-driven smart transportation systems. We focus on three major topics. First, we discuss data sources and data. Second, we provide an overview of how AI can aid decision-making with a focus on transportation. Lastly, we discuss computational problems in the transportation domain and AI approaches to these problems.",

            "abstract_KdNh5Z": "There are more than 7,000 public transit agencies in the U.S. (and many more private agencies), and together, they are responsible for serving 60 billion passenger miles each year. A well-functioning transit system fosters the growth and expansion of businesses, distributes social and economic benefits, and links the capabilities of community members, thereby enhancing what they can accomplish as a society. Since affordable public transit services are the backbones of many communities, this work investigates ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve efficiency and increase utilization from the perspective of transit agencies. This book chapter discusses the primary requirements, objectives, and challenges related to the design of AI-driven smart transportation systems. We focus on three major topics. First, we discuss data sources and data. Second, we provide an overview of how AI can aid decision-making with a focus on transportation. Lastly, we discuss computational problems in the transportation domain and AI approaches to these problems."
